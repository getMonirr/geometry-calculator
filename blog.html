            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a platform and language-natural interface. The purpose of DOM is to allow programmers to add programs and scripts to
                dynamically access and change document structure, content, and style. There are three types of DOM:
            <ul class="list-decimal list-inside py-2">
                <li>Core DOM</li>
                <li>XML DOM</li>
                <li>HTML DOM</li>
            </ul>


            We only discuss HTML DOM.
            <p class="py-2">What is the HTML DOM?</p>
            The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HML documents. It treats all HTML
            Elements as Objects.
            HTML DOM views an HTML document as a tree of nodes. Each node represents an HTML element.
            We already know that it is a programming interface so we can access all objects and it allows us to create,
            change or remove an element from the document. also, we can add so many events for each node or element like
            'click', 'mouseEnter', 'mouseMove', etc.</p>

            <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-3">2. How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.
            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">There are five different methods for selecting an element in the HTML
                document. all methods are self-explained by their name.</p>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3">
                <li><code class="text-orange-500">getElementById()</code>
                    <ul class="indent-4 list-inside">
                        <li>

                            you can select only one id at a time.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><code class="text-orange-500">getElementsByClassName()</code>
                    <ul class="indent-4 list-inside">
                        <li>

                            you can get all classes by their names that match and it gives us an HTMLCollection.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><code class="text-orange-500">getElementsByTagName()</code>
                    <ul class="indent-4 list-inside">
                        <li>

                            you can get all classes by their tags names that match and it gives us an HTMLCollection.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><code class="text-orange-500">querySelector()</code>
                    <ul class="indent-4 list-inside">
                        <li>

                            it selects an HTML element like a CSS selector.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><code class="text-orange-500">querySelectorAll()</code>
                    <ul class="indent-4 list-inside">
                        <li>

                            it selects all HTML elements that match and it gives us a NodeList.

            <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-3">3. What is event bubble?</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">Events bubbling is a concept of DOM. It describes how the browser handles
                events. when an element receives an event, and that event bubbles up (propagated) to its parent elements
                in the DOM tree until it gets to the root element. this is a default behavior of the browser. it is
                possible to prevent that? yes of course. if you can't stop bubbling it's running until getting the root
                element. you can stop it by just calling the <code class="text-orange-500">sotpPropagration()</code>
                methods. after applying the method event bubbling stops</p>

        <article class="py-10">
            <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-3">4. What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">In javascript, everything is an object.
                when we write a function, we can pass an object as a parameter. technically in javascript functions are
                also an object. so definitely we can pass a function as a parameter. it's called the call-back function.
                that means when we passed a function into a function as a parameter, which is called or invoked inside
                the function, and completes some task or action.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-3"> it's also called asynchronous programming. in JavaScript run code
                sequentially in top-down order. it's the default behavior. when we need to do something and then run
                other cases and it's not sequentially so what do? the solution to the problem is we have to use the
                callback function to do the task in a completely asynchronous way not sequentially. that's why we use
                the callback function. it's very important for asynchronous programming.</p>
